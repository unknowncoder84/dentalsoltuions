# How to Add Your Hero Background Image

## Step 1: Save Your Image

Please save the hero image (the one with smile, dental mirror, and "YOUR SMILE OUR PASSION" text) to:

```
image/hero-background.jpg
```

Or any name you prefer.

## Step 2: Let Me Know

Once you've saved it, tell me the filename and I'll:
1. Copy it to `public/images/hero-background.jpg`
2. Update the hero component to use it
3. Make it look perfect with the right overlay

## Current Status

The hero section is ready to use a real photo background. I just need you to provide the image file.

## What It Will Look Like

- Your hero image as the background
- Blue gradient overlay on the left (so text is readable)
- "Advanced Dental Care. Confident Smiles." heading
- WhatsApp, Call, and Location buttons
- Professional appearance

**Please upload the hero image to the `image` folder and let me know!**
