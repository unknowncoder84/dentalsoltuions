# ✅ Images Correctly Rotated and Fixed!

## Problem Identified:
The images were shifted by one position - each image was showing in the wrong card.

## Solution Applied:
I rotated all the images so each one now appears in the correct position.

## Correct Mapping Now:

### Position 1: Root Canal Treatment
