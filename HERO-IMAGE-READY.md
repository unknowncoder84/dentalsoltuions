# ✅ Hero Background Image Ready!

## Current Status

The hero section is now set up to use a real photo background!

### What's Working:
✅ Hero uses `hero-background.jpg` as background
✅ Blue gradient overlay for text readability
✅ Professional appearance
✅ Responsive design

---

## 🎯 To Use Your Specific Hero Image:

### Option 1: Upload Your Image
1. Save your hero image (the one with smile and dental mirror) to the `image` folder
2. Name it anything you like (e.g., `hero.jpg`)
3. Tell me the filename
4. I'll copy it to `public/images/hero-background.jpg`

### Option 2: I Can Help You
If you upload the image to the `image` folder right now, just let me know and I'll:
- Copy it to the correct location
- Verify it's displaying properly
- Make any adjustments needed

## 📸 Current Placeholder

Right now, I'm using a temporary placeholder image. Once you provide your hero image, it will look exactly like the one you showed me with:
- Beautiful smile
- Dental mirror
- "YOUR SMILE OUR PASSION" text
- Professional appearance

## 📝 Next Step
