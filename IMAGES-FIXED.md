# ✅ Service Images Fixed!

## Problem Solved

The images and descriptions were mismatched. I've corrected the mapping so each image now matches its proper description.

## Correct Mapping Now:

### Top Row:
1. **Root Canal Treatment** → Shows root canal stages image
2. **Teeth Cleaning** → Shows teeth cleaning with tool image
3. **Smile Designing** → Shows before/after smile comparison

### Bottom Row:
4. **Teeth Filling** → Shows tooth filling 3D model
5. **Teeth Whitening** → Shows teeth whitening before/after
6. **Wisdom Tooth Surgery** → Shows person with jaw pain

## What I Did:

Renamed all the image files to match their correct descriptions:
- `root-canal.jpg` → Now shows root canal treatment stages
- `teeth-cleaning.jpg` → Now shows teeth cleaning procedure
- `smile-designing.jpg` → Now shows smile designing before/after
- `teeth-filling.jpg` → Now shows teeth filling model
- `teeth-whitening.jpg` → Now shows teeth whitening comparison
- `wisdom-tooth.jpg` → Now shows wisdom tooth surgery
