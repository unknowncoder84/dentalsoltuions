## 📝 Optional: Add Real Photos Later

If you want to replace the SVG service images with your actual photos:

1. Save your photos as:
   - teeth-cleaning.jpg
   - smile-designing.jpg
   - teeth-filling.jpg
   - root-canal.jpg
   - teeth-whitening.jpg
   - wisdom-tooth.jpg

2. Place them in: `public/images/`

3. Update `components/services.tsx` to use .jpg instead of .svg

The SVG images work perfectly for now and look professional!
